                    She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn&apos;t help but feel that something horrible was about to happen.

                    It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he&apos;d finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and effort she&apos;d invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn&apos;t work out quite as she expected.

                    She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. "You need to learn to think for yourself," she wanted to tell him. <q>Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down.</q> But she didn&apos;t because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.

                    I&apos;m heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I&apos;m back here for the birthday if possible. I&apos;ll let you know as soon as I know the doctor&apos;s appointment schedule and my flight plans.

                    She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn&apos;t the most important. The last step wasn&apos;t the most important. It was the next step that was the most important.
